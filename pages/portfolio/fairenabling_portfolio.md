# What is ELIXIR's Portfolio of FAIR-enabling products?

The ELIXIR Interoperability Platform helps people and machines discover, access, integrate and analyse biological data. A big part of this remit includes maintaining an overview of tools, services, resources and standards that help users with making their data more compliant with one or more aspects of FAIR.

This "portfolio of FAIR-enabling products and services" consists of the [ELIXIR "Recommended Interoperability Resources" (RIRs)](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/interoperability/rirs), select FAIRsharing collections and the [ELIXIR Research Data Management guidelines and FAQs](https://elixir-europe.org/what-we-offer/guidelines/data-management). It is curated by the Interoperability Platform in collaboration with ELIXIR communities and end users.

# The ELIXIR "Recommended Interoperability Resources" (RIRs)

The ELIXIR Recommended Interoperability Resources (RIRs) are tools and registries that have been selected by a panel of external reviewers and are identified as resources that facilitate the FAIR-supporting activities in scientific research, such as:

- Establishing connections between data (and other) resources
- Acquiring and exposing metadata of data (and other) resources
- Creating the infrastructure needed to build integratable data collections
- Using interoperability resources to support delivery of FAIR principles

The first round of RIRs were selected in 2018 (*confirm date*), with further rounds in XX and 2023. A total of 21 resources are currently included on the list of RIRs.

## From "Recommended Interoperability Resources" to "FAIR-Enabling Resources"

As our understanding of the FAIR principles and their application evolved, the remit of the RIR portfolio shifted away from its original interoperability focus to a wider "FAIR-enabling" view. To reflect this and other concerns with the RIR selection process, the ELIXIR Interoperability programme of work 2024-2026 included a review and redesign of the RIR process, which resulted in the reimagined "FAIR-Enabling Resources" or FERs.

The new FERs benefit from an improved and clearer scope definition, a clear and conscise set of evaluation criteria and a more transparent governance process, from application to review to acceptance and continued re-evaluation. The first round of the new FER process is planned for Q2-2026.

# The ELIXIR Research Data Management guidelines and FAQs

In collaboration with the ELIXIR Research Data Management Community, the Interoperability Platform contributed to the creation of a set of [guidelines and frequently asked questions about common research data management challenges](https://elixir-europe.org/what-we-offer/guidelines/data-management). The guidelines are illustrated through a set of user journeys that leverage resources from the FAIR-enabling portfolio, such as the RDMkit, the FAIR Cookbook, FAIRsharing and the Data Stewardship Wizard (DSW), and the connections between them.
