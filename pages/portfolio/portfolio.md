title: ELIXIR's Portfolio of FAIR-enabling products

This page is a **USER GUIDE** to ELIXIR FAIR service portfolio, including FAIRsharing factsheets, and improved ELIXIR web pages.

## What is ELIXIR's Portfolio of FAIR-enabling products?

The ELIXIR Interoperability Platform helps people and machines discover, access, integrate and analyse biological data. A big part of this remit includes maintaining an overview of tools, services, resources and standards that help users with making their data more compliant with one or more aspects of FAIR.

This "portfolio of FAIR-enabling products and services" consists of the [ELIXIR "Recommended Interoperability Resources" (RIRs)](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/interoperability/rirs), select FAIRsharing collections and the [ELIXIR Research Data Management guidelines and FAQs](https://elixir-europe.org/what-we-offer/guidelines/data-management). It is curated by the Interoperability Platform in collaboration with ELIXIR communities and end users.

## The ELIXIR "Recommended Interoperability Resources" (RIRs)

The ELIXIR Recommended Interoperability Resources (RIRs) are tools and registries that have been selected by a panel of external reviewers and are identified as resources that facilitate the FAIR-supporting activities in scientific research, such as:

- Establishing connections between data (and other) resources
- Acquiring and exposing metadata of data (and other) resources
- Creating the infrastructure needed to build integratable data collections
- Using interoperability resources to support delivery of FAIR principles

The first round of RIRs were selected in 2018, with further rounds in 2019 and 2023. A total of 21 resources are currently included on the list of RIRs.

### From "Recommended Interoperability Resources" to "ELIXIR FAIR-Enabling Resources"

As our understanding of the FAIR principles and their application evolved, the remit of the RIR portfolio shifted away from its original interoperability focus to a wider "FAIR-enabling" view. To reflect this and other concerns with the RIR selection process, the ELIXIR Interoperability programme of work 2024-2026 included a review and redesign of the RIR process, which resulted in the reimagined "ELIXIR FAIR-Enabling Resources" or ELIXIR FERs.

The new ELIXIR FERs benefit from an improved and clearer scope definition, a clear and conscise set of evaluation criteria and a more transparent governance process, from application to review to acceptance and continued re-evaluation. The first round of the new FER process is planned for Q2-2026.

## FAIRsharing Collections

FAIRsharing Collections group together one or more types of resource (standard, database or policy) by domain, project or organisation. In the context of the ELIXIR Interoperability Platform, FAIRsharing worked with representatives from the ELIXIR Biodiversity and Toxicology communities to create FAIRsharing Collections to represent the best practice in their respective domains. Each collection has an associatated report published on Zenodo.

## FAIRsharing Factsheets

FAIRsharing publishes a range of educational resources, known as ["Factsheets"](https://fairsharing.org/educational), to educate and guide users not only through FAIRsharing itself but also through the world of FAIR.

Factsheets that are of particular interest in the context of FAIR-enabling resources include:

- [FAIR Principles in a nutshell](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12167786)
- [FAIRsharing content: standards overview](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8186982)
- [FAIRsharing content: databases overview](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8186961)
- [FAIRsharing for you: developers and curators](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8186594)
- [FAIRsharing for you: librarians, trainers, data stewards](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8186609)
- [FAIRsharing for you: researchers](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8186952)

## The ELIXIR Research Data Management guidelines and FAQs

In collaboration with the ELIXIR Research Data Management Community, the Interoperability Platform contributed to the creation of a set of [guidelines and frequently asked questions about common research data management challenges](https://elixir-europe.org/what-we-offer/guidelines/data-management) (citable version published on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14710086)). The guidelines are illustrated through a set of user journeys that leverage resources from the FAIR-enabling portfolio, such as the RDMkit, the FAIR Cookbook, FAIRsharing and the Data Stewardship Wizard (DSW), and the connections between them.
